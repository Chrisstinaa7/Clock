Project Title: Object-Oriented Java Clock

Description:
For this project, I developed a robust and versatile Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based Java Clock application consisting of three major classes: NumberDisplay, ClockDisplay, and ClockDriver. The NumberDisplay class encapsulates a numerical value with a specified limit, allowing for seamless cycling and formatting. The ClockDisplay class leverages NumberDisplay to create a fully functional clock with hour, minute, and second displays. The clock ticks in real-time, demonstrating my proficiency in Java and OOP principles.

Key Features and Contributions:

Modular Design: The project follows a modular design approach with well-encapsulated classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Encapsulation and Abstraction: I utilized encapsulation and abstraction to hide the complexity of the clock's internal workings, making it easy to use and understand.
User Interaction: The ClockDriver class provides a user-friendly interface for setting the clock's initial time, allowing users to interact with the clock application.
Real-Time Functionality: The clock updates the time in real-time, showcasing my ability to implement real-time systems in Java.
Challenges Overcome:
During the development of this project, I faced challenges related to time formatting, ensuring that the clock maintained accurate time, and managing user input. I successfully addressed these challenges through careful planning, testing, and debugging, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

Conclusion:
This project not only demonstrates my expertise in Java programming and OOP but also showcases my commitment to creating well-structured and efficient software solutions. It's a testament to my ability to build real-time applications and encapsulate complex functionality into user-friendly interfaces.
